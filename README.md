# Forge mod Session-stealing-exploit
I take no credit for this, all credit goes to Janrupf#6659 on discord or https://github.com/Janrupf. He created this as a proof of concept after I had commented on the MultiMC discord warning people of the exploit. This is designed to be just a proof of concept so a gui is not available
Mod is for version 1.12.2
Add the jar into your folder and run game.
